# condition.link-opened

Checks that the user clicked the link.

[View example in the sandbox](https://clck.ru/asS5W).

**Important:** To trigger the condition, the user must follow the link from the Toloka interface â€” you must give users this option. The condition will not work if the user opens the link from the browser address bar.

This condition can be used in the [view.link](view.link.md) component and also anywhere you can use _(conditions)_.
