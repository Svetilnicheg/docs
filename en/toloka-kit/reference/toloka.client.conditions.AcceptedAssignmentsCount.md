# AcceptedAssignmentsCount
`toloka.client.conditions.AcceptedAssignmentsCount`

```python
AcceptedAssignmentsCount(
    self,
    operator: CompareOperator,
    value: Optional[int] = None
)
```

How many times this assignment was accepted


Don't be confused!!!
This condition used only with 'AssignmentsAssessment' controller.
And exist very similar condition 'AssignmentsAcceptedCount', that used only with 'AnswerCount' controller.
Sorry about that.
