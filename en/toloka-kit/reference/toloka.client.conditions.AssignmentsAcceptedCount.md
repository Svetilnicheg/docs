    operator: CompareOperator,
    value: Optional[int] = None
)
```

How many assignment was accepted from performer


Don't be confused!!!
This condition used only with 'AnswerCount' controller.
And exist very similar condition 'AcceptedAssignmentsCount', that used only with 'AssignmentsAssessment' controller.
Sorry about that.
