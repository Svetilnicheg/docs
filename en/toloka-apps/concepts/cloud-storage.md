# Where to store files

[Photo hosting](#image-hosting)

[Cloud storage](#cloud)

[Creating a markup element](#tsv-create)

If your task requires images, audio, or video files, upload them to [photo hosting](#image-hosting) or [cloud storage](#cloud) and provide links to them in the TSV, CSV, JSON, or XLSX-file.

If you need to add less than 10 images, use photo hosting. If you need to add more images, or audio and video files, use cloud storage.

{% cut "TSV" %}

TSV (tab-separated values) is a text file format, in which data is separated by tab symbols, and strings â€” with the newline symbol.

{% endcut %}

## Photo hosting {#image-hosting}

Some photo hosting services are free and don't require registration. This way you can quickly and easily upload your files and get links to them. But they have limitations. For example, [wampi](https://wampi.ru/?lang=en) doesn't allow people to use their service for commercial purposes. Images uploaded without creating an account can be deleted if they are not accessed for a year. We recommend you to read the terms of use before using photo hosting services.

{% note info %}

The information about the terms is provided here for informational purposes.

The terms may be changed by the service unilaterally. You can view changes on the photo hosting website.

Toloka is not responsible for such changes or for placing them in this section within a certain timeframe.

## Cloud storage {#cloud}

In Object Storage terms, files and folders are _objects_. All objects are stored in buckets. A _bucket_ is a logical entity that helps organize object storage.

Cloud storage enables users to store large amounts of data. You need to pay to use it. To try out a service, use a free trial.
