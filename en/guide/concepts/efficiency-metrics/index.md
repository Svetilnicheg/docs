# Efficiency metrics

{% note warning "Important" %}

Efficiency metrics are available to a limited number of customers. Fill out this [form](https://toloka.ai/request-early-access/) if you want to get access to this feature.

{% endnote %}

Toloka has a set of indicators using which you can estimate if your project is configured correctly. You can make decisions faster based on the efficiency indicators. For example, you can find out which pool settings you can modify to boost quality and labeling speed.

You can find this information in the **Efficiency** tab on the pool page:

- [Control tasks](control-tasks-share.md)
- [Rejected tasks](rejected-tasks.md)
- [Submission rate](submitting-tasks.md)
- [Project availability](available-performers.md)
- [Bans](ban-rate.md)
- [Control task balance](control-tasks-balance.md)
- [Quality of instructions](instruction-quality.md)

## Features {#features}

- Efficiency metrics are recalculated every 15 minutes.

- Changes in the settings of projects and pools do not lead to an instant change in indicators.

- The percentage is calculated for the last 2 days.
