{% cut "How do I change my account type from “Requester” to “Toloker”?" %}

You can't change the account type from “Requester” to “Toloker”.

If you want to complete tasks, you need to register in Toloka once again, with a different username, but as a Toloker.

To create a Toloker account:

1. Log out of your requester account.

1. Go to the [Toloka]({{ toloka-index }}) home page.

1. Click **Join**.

1. Follow the system instructions.

{% note info %}

You can use the same phone number to create a new account. For a step-by-step description of the registration process, see [Registration and login]({{ user-documentation }}).
