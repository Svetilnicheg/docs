# Data security

Toloka cares about the security of your data and data labeling results. This section describes the key principles of working with data in Toloka.

We also advise that you read our [recommendations for data protection in Toloka.](protect-your-data.md#protect-from-them)

## Key principles {#data-security-important_1}

- The rights to the results with labeled data belong to the requester, and no one else.
- The data that the requester sends to Toloka is strictly confidential. Support staff have access to this data. The list of employees granted this access is regularly reviewed and their activities are monitored by our team.
    {% note warning %}

    If necessary, the requester may grant [access](multiple-access.md#ul_pyj_v3k_xlb) to their account to other users, for example, to their employees.

    {% endnote %}

- Tolokers must treat the requester's data as confidential: this is stipulated in the [User Agreement]({{ useragreement }}). We make sure that no fraudulent users get access to Toloka: cheaters get a warning or ban.

## Personal data {#personal-data}

By transmitting data to Toloka, you automatically agree to this data being processed by third parties, namely, Tolokers in Toloka.

To avoid transmitting personal data, you can anonymize the data yourself. For example, you can cover up people's faces in photos and change the pitch of the voice in speech recordings.

For tasks that use recognition of passports or questionnaires with personal information, you can cut out data fields and use separate tasks for them. For example, you can send the last name, first name, and middle name separately for recognition.

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

#### How do I change my account type from <q>Requester</q> to <q>Toloker</q>?

You can't change the account type from <q>Requester</q> to <q>Toloker</q>.

If you want to complete tasks, you need to register in Toloka once again, with a different username, but as a Toloker.

To create a Toloker account:
1. Log out of your requester account.
1. Go to the [Toloka]({{ toloka-index }}) home page.
1. Click **Join**.
1. Follow the system instructions.

{% note info %}

You can use the same phone number to create a new account. For a step-by-step description of the registration process, see [Registration and login]({{ user-documentation }}).

{% endnote %}

#### The phone number belongs to another user

If you see this warning, make sure you entered the phone number correctly.

Please note that you can only have one requester account per phone number (see the [User Agreement]({{ useragreement }})).

If your [Yandex ID]({{ phones }}) is linked to the wrong number, change it. For more information about linking a phone number, see [Yandex ID Help]({{ authorization-phone }}).

If you don't remember your credentials in Toloka, use [Restoring access]({{ restore }}).

If you deleted your Toloka account, create a new Yandex ID and register in Toloka.

#### How do I change the phone number in my account?

To change your phone number, go to [Yandex ID]({{ phones }}) and change your main number.

{% note info %}

If you don't have access to the old number, it takes a month to replace it. For more information about changing the phone number, see [Yandex ID Help]({{ change-phone }}).
