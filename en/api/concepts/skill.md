# Overview

A skillÂ is an assessment of some aspect of a Toloker's responses (a number from 0 to 100). You can set up skill calculation in a [quality control rule](quality_control.md), or manually set the skill level for a Toloker. You can use skills to [select Tolokers](filter-skill.md) who perform pool tasks.
